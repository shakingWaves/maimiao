Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.
Remember me to one who lives there,
She once was the true love of mine.
Tell her to make me a cambric shirt.
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.
Without no seams nor needlework.
Then she'll bo be a true love of mine.
Tell her to find me an acre of land.
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.
Between salt water and the sea strand.
Then she'll be a true love of mine.
Tell her to reap it in a sickle of leather.
Parsley, xiao sage, rosemary, and thyme.
And gather it all in a bunch of heather.
Then she'll be a true love of mine.
Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.
